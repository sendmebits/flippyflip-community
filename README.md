Players navigate through a **tier-based progression system**, unlocking new challenges as they master previous ones.

## 📱 Game Play

The core mechanic revolves around valid square selections:
1.  **Select**: Drag to select a square region (minimum 2x2).
2.  **Flip**: Upon release, all tiles within the selection flip states (White ↔️ Black).
3.  **Solve**: The level is complete when all tiles on the grid are white.
4.  **Undo**: Tap the undo button to revert the last flip.
